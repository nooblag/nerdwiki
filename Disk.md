# Disk stuff
Operations for disk space, etc.

## File size

#### Show usage of all disks, human readable numbers
`df -h`

#### To list the top 10 largest files from the current directory
`du -h . | sort -nr | head -n10`

#### To list the largest directories from the current directory
`du -sh * | sort -nr | head -n10`


#### How to find total size on disk of certain filetypes, recursive.

In this case, total file size in GB of MP4 files by using combo of *find*, *du* and *awk*:

`find . -name "*.mp4" -print0 | du -sb --files0-from=-  | awk '{ total += $1} END { print total/1024/1024/1024 }'`

`find -name "*.mp4" -exec du -b {} \; | awk 'BEGIN{total=0}{total=total+$1}END{print total}'`

*"The -exec option of find command executes a simple command with {} as the file found by find. du -b displays the size of the file in bytes. The awk command initializes a variable at 0 and get the size of each file to display the total at the end of the command."*

## Swappiness

`echo 90 > /proc/sys/vm/swappiness`

If you prefer to keep applications nearly always in RAM you could set this to 1. If you set this to zero, kernel will not swap at all unless absolutely necessary to avoid Out Of Memory. If you were memory limited and working with big files (e.g. HD video editing), then it might make sense to set this close to 100.


*vfs_cache_pressure*
Controls the tendency of the kernel to reclaim the memory which is used for caching of directory and inode objects.

At the default value of vfs_cache_pressure=100 the kernel will attempt to reclaim dentries and inodes at a "fair" rate with respect to pagecache and swapcache reclaim. Decreasing vfs_cache_pressure causes the kernel to prefer to retain dentry and inode caches. When vfs_cache_pressure=0, the kernel will never reclaim dentries and inodes due to memory pressure and this can easily lead to out-of-memory conditions. Increasing vfs_cache_pressure beyond 100 causes the kernel to prefer to reclaim dentries and inodes.
